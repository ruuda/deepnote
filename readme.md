# Deepnote

Generate embeddings of music tracks, albums, and artists, based on listening
histories, for similarity comparisons and ultimately music recommendation.
Basically, word2vec applied to listening histories.

There is nothing deep about the model; in fact it is extremely shallow. But
“deepnote” sounds more catchy than “shallownote”.
